# LateAcceptanceGeneticAlgorithm-LAGA-
modified version of the genetic algorithm to solve software project scheduling and staffing problems. 
The late acceptance genetic algorithm solved the problem of premature convergence that the genetic algorithm had. This project approach can be used to create more efficient project management applications using Python (NumPy)
